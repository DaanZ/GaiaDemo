Packaging Design:
Kicking off a new decade of WhistlePig Whiskey tail first
Background:
WhistlePig has always been a rule breaker and convention shaker. So no surprise then that inspiration for their latest show stopper came from the prohibition era. In an effort to circumvent liquor taxes, 19th Century distillers took to adding small amounts of herbal bitters to gin and sold it without taxation under the guise of ‘medicinal liquor.’ Cheeky. The Berkshire Pig is a favorite example of this. The pig shaped bottle was not only used as a representation of the evils of drink, but the cork plug in the rear of the bottle allowed for lots of crude jokes which elevated its popularity (of course).


Part of WhistlePig’s purpose is to inspire and support the next generation of rule-breakers. The brand considers itself leaders and risk takers. They strive to be progressive and provocative, fearless & independent. And they love candor and experimentation. The design for PiggyBank was no exception.








We bottled a Straight Rye Whiskey aged 10 years at 110 proof in a 1-liter replica Berkshire Bitter Pig decanter that pours from the backside.


Idea:
In conjunction, WhistlePig auctioned an original 19th-century, antique Berkshire Bitter Pig filled with 20-year-old Rye Whiskey – 10 years for the first decade, 10 for the next – at an auction hosted by Christie’s in June 2022. The lot closed for $125,000 by winning bidder Rally 2 Give, with all proceeds benefiting “the next generation of world citizens via the Gumball 3000 Foundation.”





What We Did:
Deemed as one of the 15 Most Exciting Bourbons and Whiskeys of 2022
Became an instant collectors item with Berkshire Pigs bottle changing hands for $800 (if you could get close enough for a butt sniff)
Generated $125,000 for charity
