Social Impact Campaign:
Turning a film into a movement
Background:
The Amazon is burning. And the indigenous people who live there are under threat, too. These tribes are the guardians of all of us. They protect the land that creates 20% of the oxygen we breathe. That’s every 5th breath. If the people of the Amazon disappear, so might the rainforest. And so might we all.

Céline Cousteau, granddaughter of the legendary Jaque Cousteau, is an activist and filmmaker. Her grandfather opened her eyes and heart to the Amazon and the indigenous tribes who live there when she was a young girl. And she spent years studying and earning the trust of these important people. Because of this trust, she was able to create a documentary to bring their story to the world.  Tribes on the Edge is a documentary and a vehicle to give voice to the struggling tribes of the amazon rainforest.

Approach:
By helping American audiences understand the link between every 5th breath and the indigenous people and guardians of the Amazon forest, we made their plight local, individual and important.


Idea:
We took a grassroots approach, working with 6 production and distribution partners to organize private screenings across the US. That allowed us to make the Tribes on the Edge personal through theaters, arts centers and corporate offices — including Kickstarter and Salesforce.
