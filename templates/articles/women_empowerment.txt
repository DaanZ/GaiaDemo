Women Empowerment on stage at Paris Olympics
The Paris Olympics 2024 emerged as a groundbreaking event for women empowerment, marking a historic achievement with full gender parity for the first time ever. This milestone showcased not only the incredible talents of women athletes but also their unwavering commitment to advancing gender equality.

Throughout the Games, women athletes used their platforms to challenge entrenched issues like body shaming, gender policing, and media bias, sparking a global dialogue on women empowerment.

From viral displays of solidarity to impactful social media campaigns, the Paris Olympics 2024 illuminated the powerful role of women empowerment in reshaping the narrative of sports. This transformative event celebrated the profound progress made while underscoring the continued need for advancement in gender equality on and off the field.

How Has Women Empowerment Evolved in the Olympic Games?
A brief history of women’s participation in the Olympics from Paris 1900 to Paris 2024.
Women first participated in the Olympic Games in Paris in 1900, with 22 female athletes competing in five sports. Fast forward to Paris 2024, where the Games have achieved full gender parity with an equal number of male and female athletes—5,250 each. This journey from limited inclusion to equal representation is a testament to the strides made in women’s empowerment over the past century.

The promotion of women in the Olympics became a mission of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1996, and since then, numerous initiatives have been undertaken to enhance female participation. By Tokyo 2020, nearly 49% of the athletes were women, and Paris 2024 marks the first Olympics to achieve full gender parity in participation. Despite this progress, women’s Olympic events have often been sidelined by the media, and male athletes have historically enjoyed greater publicity and sponsorship opportunities.

The journey towards gender parity: Achievements and ongoing challenges.
Achieving gender parity at the Paris 2024 Olympics is a historic accomplishment, but it’s crucial to understand that parity in numbers does not equate to equality in experience. While female athletes now compete in equal numbers to their male counterparts, disparities persist in pay, media coverage, leadership roles and perpetuated hetero-normative stereotypes of femininity. For instance, women athletes still face significant challenges in achieving equal pay and media representation. The journey towards true gender equality in the Olympics involves addressing these deep-rooted issues and ensuring that women receive the same recognition, opportunities, and basic respect as men.

Are Women Empowered More Than Ever?
Understanding the difference between gender parity and gender equality in sports.
Gender parity, as achieved in Paris 2024, refers to equal participation of men and women in the Games. However, gender equality goes beyond numbers, encompassing equal opportunities, pay, media coverage, and the elimination of discrimination and bias. Despite the progress made, the road to gender equality in the Olympics is still fraught with challenges, including gender policing, biased media coverage, and pay gaps that disproportionately affect women athletes.

Pay gaps remain a critical issue, with women often earning less than their male counterparts despite achieving similar or even greater success. Additionally, media coverage of women’s sports lags behind that of men’s sports, both in terms of quantity and quality. These disparities not only undermine the achievements of women athletes but also perpetuate outdated stereotypes and biases.

Women Empowerment Took Center Stage at the Olympics’ Global Arena
Solidarity Among Women Athletes
The Paris Olympics 2024 has become a global stage where women, particularly Black women and women of color, have demonstrated exceptional grace both in victory and defeat. Their actions have redefined what it means to be a competitor, emphasizing the strength found in unity and support.

A striking example of this was seen in the women’s gymnastics competition. Even when they didn’t stand at the top of the podium, the gymnasts from Team USA made headlines for their heartfelt praise of Brazil’s gold medalist, Rebeca Andrade. Their collective support at the medal ceremony went viral, showcasing a powerful image that reflects the evolution of women’s gymnastics—a sport once marked by fierce rivalry now stands as a beacon of camaraderie and mutual respect.

These moments not only highlight the athletes’ individual achievements but also underscore a broader narrative of women empowerment. By uplifting one another, these women are breaking down traditional barriers, fostering a culture where competition is driven by mutual respect and shared victories.

Women Empowerment on the Catwalk: Celebrating Women Athletes at the Paris Olympics 2024
The Paris Olympics 2024 not only celebrated athletic excellence but also became a powerful platform for women empowerment, showcasing solidarity and community among female athletes.

One of the standout moments was the symbolic catwalk event where women athletes walked down the runway, embodying gender equality in sports. This event wasn’t just about fashion—it was a powerful statement for equality. Many athletes wore T-shirts with slogans like “Parity Paris” and “Role Model,” highlighting their commitment to inspiring future generations and advocating for equal opportunities in sports.

Are Women Empowered Enough in Leadership Roles at the Olympics?
The underrepresentation of women in coaching roles at the Olympics.
One of the most glaring areas of gender inequality in the Olympics is the underrepresentation of women in coaching roles. At the Tokyo Olympics, only 13% of coaches were women, and this number is expected to decrease in Paris 2024. This lack of representation in coaching is a significant barrier to achieving true gender equality in sports. Women coaches bring valuable perspectives and mentorship to female athletes, and increasing their presence is crucial for empowering women in all aspects of the Olympic Games.

The importance of increasing women leadership in sports organizations.
To achieve gender equality, it is essential to increase representation in leadership roles within sports organizations. This includes not only coaching but also positions within the International Olympic Committee and other governing bodies. Currently, female IOC membership stands at 41%, a significant increase from previous years, but still short of true parity. Promoting women to leadership positions is vital for ensuring that their voices are heard and that the policies and practices of the Olympic Games reflect the needs and perspectives of women athletes.

Gender Policing to Women Empowerment
To truly advance women empowerment in sports, it’s imperative to redefine femininity to celebrate strength, diversity, and athletic prowess rather than adhering to outdated beauty standards that are often rooted in Eurocentric and heteronormative ideals.

The Paris Olympics 2024 offered a pivotal chance to challenge entrenched norms and promote a more inclusive view of femininity that honors all facets of women’s athleticism. However, the Olympic framework still operates within a binary system that often imposes stringent gender norms. Women athletes frequently face gender policing, where they must validate their “womanhood” to compete.

These criticisms are rooted in an antiquated notion of femininity that equates being a woman with frailness, diminutiveness—traits historically used to undermine women’s strength, capabilities and ultimately power. Men are not subjected to such invasive scrutiny or biased expectations. It’s time to shift the conversation and redefine femininity not by proximity to weakness, but by the inherent strength and potential that all women possess.

Women olympians should be celebrated for their power and achievements, rather than judged on a global scale for not embodying Eurocentric, heteronormative beauty standards.

How Are Women Athletes Using Their Platforms to Empower Others?
Success Stories: Women athletes prove to be powerful beyond the arena.
Beyond their achievements on the field, women athletes are making a significant impact off the field by advocating for issues that affect women worldwide. For example, Lin YuTing and Imane Khelif have used their platforms to speak out against the transphobia and misogyny they faced during the Olympics, turning their personal experiences into powerful calls for change and empowering women and girls around the world. These athletes are not only breaking records but also breaking down barriers, proving that their influence extends far beyond the sports arena.

Leveraging social media and public visibility to advocate for change.
Women athletes are increasingly using their platforms to champion women empowerment, using the Olympic spotlight to tackle issues like body shaming, gender stereotypes, and online harassment. Although female athletes command a social media following that is 14% larger than their male counterparts, they remain underrepresented in mainstream news coverage. Social media has become a powerful tool for these athletes to amplify their voices and reach a global audience, inspiring others to join the fight for gender equality.

What Are the Next Steps for Women Empowerment in Future Olympics?
Building on the progress of the Paris Olympics: What more needs to be done?
While the Paris Olympics 2024 marks a significant milestone for women empowerment in sports, there is still much work to be done. Future Olympics must continue to build on the progress made in Paris by addressing the ongoing challenges that women athletes face. This includes increasing research focused on women athletes, providing better support for women coaches, and ensuring that women’s sports receive the same level of media coverage and sponsorship as men’s sports.

The role of organizations, sponsors and media in promoting gender equality.
Organizations, sponsors, and the media play a crucial role in empowering women in sports and in general. These entities hold significant power in shaping narratives and fostering an environment where women athletes can thrive. While the Paris Olympics 2024 made strides in showcasing gender parity, true equality in sports requires the ongoing support of these key stakeholders.

Organizations play a pivotal role by creating programs and initiatives that support women athletes and promote gender equality in sports. Sponsors, on the other hand, can ensure equitable financial support and visibility for women’s sports, bridging the gap in sponsorship opportunities that often favors male athletes.

Media, with its vast reach and influence, is perhaps the most powerful tool in changing public perception and promoting gender equality. However, despite progress, women’s sports continue to receive less coverage and are often subject to biased portrayals. It is crucial for media outlets to commit to balanced coverage that highlights the achievements and stories of women athletes with the same vigor as their male counterparts.

At Grounded World, we recognize the power of media in driving social change. Our collaboration with the nonprofit organization Plan International on the Girl Vs. The Machine campaign exemplifies how strategic media initiatives can be used to challenge entrenched gender stereotypes. This multi-award-winning campaign, which focused on dismantling barriers faced by women and girls globally, reflects the same spirit of women empowerment that women athletes showcased at the Paris Olympics. By leveraging our expertise as a social impact marketing agency, we continue to support and amplify efforts that promote gender equality in media, sports, and beyond.

As we look towards future Olympics, it is essential that these entities continue to champion women’s empowerment ensuring that gender equality is not just an aspiration, but a reality in all aspects of life, including sports.
