Certified B Corporations like to proudly display their B Corp Certification by placing the “B” mark on storefront windows, websites, and packaging (to name a few places). But B Corp Certification is more than just a mark. It’s a global movement of people going beyond business as usual to make their company better for all people and the planet.

What is a Certified B Corp?
Certified B Corporations are for-profit companies that are leaders in a global movement dedicated to achieving an inclusive, equitable, and regenerative economy. B Corp was founded by B Labs, a nonprofit network, whose mission is to transform the global economy to benefit all people, communities, and the planet. Founded in 2006 with 82 Certified B Corps certified in 2007,  there are now more than six thousand Certified B Corporations in more than 80 countries and over 150 industries.

What is the process for B Corp certification?
At the beginning of the B Corp Certification process, companies must undergo an assessment of risk factors based on their industry and other practices. The risk standards are developed and evolved by B Lab’s Standards Advisory Council which is an independent, multi-stakeholder group including members from around the world with specific expertise in responsible and sustainable business.

Companies that have been in operation for 12 months must meet the the below certification requirements:

Scoring Requirement – Certified B Corps are required to score a minimum of 80 points (out of 200) on the B Impact Assessment and pass a disclosure questionnaire review
Legal Requirement – Certified B Corps must update their corporate and legal governance structures to allow them to consider the impact of their decisions on all their stakeholders
Transparency Requirement – After becoming a Certified B Corp, companies will be eligible to have their company profile (with their impact report) listed in the B Corporation Directory
Companies must complete the B Impact Assessment (BIA) which is a free, digital tool that can help measure, manage, and improve a company’s positive impact performance. The BIA asks a series of questions about the company’s practices and outputs across the following categories:

Governance – policies and practices pertaining to a company’s mission, ethics, accountability, and transparency
Workers – employees’ financial, physical, professional, and social well-being
Community – economic and social well-being of the communities in which a company operates
Environment – policies and practices pertaining to a company’s environmental stewardship
Customers – verification that your products and services improve the impact of your clients/customers/consumers
In order for a company to keep their status as a Certified B Corp, the company will need to re-certify every three years and use the B Impact Assessment and the certification process as a tool for continuous improvement. There has been a growing demand to become a Certified B Corp and applications for B Corp status and waiting times to become certified have been rapidly increasing. So, we encourage anyone who is thinking about becoming a Certified B Corp to get started right away! Check out the free B Impact Assessment to measure your impact.
