Brand Purpose & Performance Art
by Phil White | Mar 31, 2019

THE IMPACT OF ART

Often overlooked, art can have a pivotal impact on social and political change. Art encourages new concepts and ideas and can motivate society to consider a new point of view – so when it comes to social impact – it can have tremendous influence and power. Whether it’s a sculpture presentation by Washed Ashore to point out the detriments of plastic pollution in our world’s oceans, or the past Safe Passage exhibition by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei to bring attention to the European refugee crisis, art serves the purpose of bringing critical issues to the table.

ARTIFYING MISSION AT THE MO SUMMIT

Here at Grounded, we believe strongly in the impact of the arts in society and this is why we are partnering with two artistes Savon Bartley & Chesney Snow to express creatively and dynamically how purpose can drive all actions across an organization – uniting people, products, processes and performances – as well as providing the narrative for all internal and external communications. This partnership demonstrates how the power of live performance art, workshop facilitation and improvisation can bring a company’s purpose to life – transforming it into a living, breathing, and highly compelling expression of purpose and the human spirit within an organization.

‍

The MO Summit next week (April 4-5) in Ashville, NorthCarolina will feature CEOs from across the impact investment and social entrepreneurial world who will present their innovative ideas on addressing complex global problems by utilizing their expertise from the business world.  During the Real Leaders Impact 100 Gala Dinner, Grounded and Create 2030 will demonstrate how a poet, beatboxer, film maker and a DJ can bring a corporate mission to life through performance art. Savon Bartley, a poet, award- winning writer, and performer and Co-founder of Create 2030, uses his passion for storytelling and poetry to address the narrative of masculinity, social justice, and the black experience.

Also performing alongside Savon will be Chesney Snow, an award winning New York City based theatre artist known for originating the role of Boxman in the Broadway acappella musical In Transit.  Chesney is widely considered a pioneering figure in the world of beatboxing culture with his work, American Beatboxer, being archived in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Harvard University Hip Hop archive where he was an artist-in residence.

In addition to the performances, Grounded will run an interactive workshop that involves getting up close and personal with these artists – all of whom are accomplished at conveying story, meaning, motive and impact through artistic expression in a way that can move us all beyond reason and inspire creativity and innovation.

‍

The MO Summit will also feature many more events and speakers all of which are under the theme of CEOs and business leaders utilizing their power, knowledge, and experience  for the benefit of our society and environment.
